10,2,1,370468,We liked the photo booth at the entrance We liked the food served for breakfast The gym room was quite interesting Some of the staff at the reception and especially at the restaurant were passive aggressive It is not what you want to experience at a hotel We found the rules around payment for breakfast quite irrational During check in we had to commit to having breakfast everyday for a set fee otherwise we would have to pay 5 Euros extra per person per day for walk ins Having no idea how breakfast is like at check in it is absolutely an annoying choice a guest is asked to make We ended up paying more for the same breakfast Not what you want to experience at a hotel We stayed at the hotel twice our first room was quite small and it was difficult to move inside the room with multiple bags We were told it was one of the largest rooms and were then given a much larger room for our second stay,,,1,,,,,,,

26,1,0,170097,The location and the staff is great The room was very clean and quiet It is a very nice alternative if you want to stay in a small and well decorated hotel in the centre of London The elevator broke and we were on the 4th floor But the help from staff covered this Another thing is that even though we emailed the facility and confirm the total rate including taxes or any extras we have not been informed that we needed to pay 200 GBP deposit per night We were on a business trip and didn t have that amount of money with us The reception was not very helpful on this matter but after a long discussion we managed to lower the deposit 100 GBP per night,,,1,,,,,,,

33,1,0,285908,The room was thorougly cleaned with fresh towels every day We got coffee and tea in the room loved the bathroom Our room was on the First floor we could hear noise from the Metro and from the street but great location though The water had chlorine smell like from the pool and isn t good for drinking,,,1,,,,,,,
34,2,0,512060,Breakfast was good one of our rooms was upgraded to a bigger suite one station away to train station walking distance to the palace two supermarket nearby It says it s with AC but when we tried to switch it on it looks like it s locked from central control When ask hotel staff they said they are fixing it But the fans in the room shows hat they are not honest to be honest it wasn t hot at night Just be prepared the AC won t be working,,,1,,,,,,,

47,1,0,385115,Reliable wifi and air conditioning Good size TV Superior marble faced bathroom Carrefour supermarket and restaurants nearby Helpful reception Double glazing so a nice quiet room if the neighbours are cooperative A little variation in the breakfast buffet would be appreciated Tranquility levels at night are overly dependent on the consideration of neighbouring guests i e thin walls Removing the card key doesn t switch off the air conditioning when you leave which wastes energy Would prefer the fridge to be empty so I don t have to remove minibar items to put my own in,,"0,7","0,3",,,,,,,

53,1,0,162345,I stayed at this hotel in November 2016 It was a really nice experience First of all I arrived at the hotel at 11 30 I asked about early checking in my comments while booking but there was no guarantee Smiling lady from the reception kept me amused with conversation for the half hour while my room was preparing At 12 00 I had a rest in my room and my early check in was absolutely for free I would like to say that all staff was nice and friendly My room was small but clean quite comfortable and there was a very good big enough and well equipped bathroom Towels were extremely white and soft Shower cabin had a tropical rain option and it was a pleasant addition to the standard facilities There was also mini bar with free of charge snacks and a bottle of water which were delivered every day Another pleasant surprise was an international plug it was truly convenient to be independent of power adaptor And another one and very important advantage was location The hotel was perfect situated in London City and had the best value for money The only problem I faced during my staying was almost absent wardrobe I believe the problem could be partly solved with nailing a board with 3 4 hooks for cloths plus several shoulders By the way additional shoulders were given to me immediately when I asked about it,,1,,,,,,,,

60,1,0,432149,Great breakfast but the restaurant for meals was a little lacking in variety The atmosphere on the terrace was outstanding with views all over Barcelona Staff were very helpful and obliging although on one day our room wasn t serviced Never had a bed linen change in the 5 nights we stayed,,"0,5","0,5",,,,,,,

70,1,0,402446,Beautiful large room great looking modern feel incredibly good location and very friendly staff When booking my search was specifically for a central hotel with parking provided The booking said parking is possible on site reservation is not needed and costs Euro24 per day However when we arrived having to leave the car in a loading bay the receptionist seemed surprised we wanted parking and could only direct us to nearby public parking buildings costing either 30 or 50 euros per day,,,1,,,,,,,
